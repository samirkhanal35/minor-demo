# Description:
It is a sample demo of how 'Nepali Digit Recognizer' works.<br/>
In this demo, I have done all the image preprocessing using OpenCV which is originally done using Python loops.<br/><br/>

Its original project code can be found <a href="https://github.com/samirkhanal35/Nepali-digit-recognizer">here</a>.<br/><br/>

It is hosted <a href="https://minor-demo.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
